\title{Calculate Variable Importance Direction for Encoded Dimensions}
\usage{
vimp_direction(encoder, test_data, threshold = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{encoder}{A Keras encoder model.}

\item{test_data}{A matrix or data frame of test data to be encoded.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. If provided, coefficients with absolute value below this threshold will be set to 0. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A matrix where each column represents an encoded dimension and each row represents an input feature.
        Values are -1 (negative relationship), 0 (no significant relationship), or 1 (positive relationship).
}
\description{
This function calculates the direction of importance for each input feature
with respect to each encoded dimension in an autoencoder model.
}
\details{
The function fits a simple linear regression for each pair of input feature and encoded dimension.
The sign of the regression coefficient determines the direction of the relationship.
If a threshold is provided, weak relationships (as determined by the threshold) are set to 0.
